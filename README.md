# knight-travails-graph
A submission in Odin project

- Aim:  
-> Find the shortest path for a knight between two boxes in a chess board  
  
- What I learnt:  
-> How graphs are implemented internally  
-> How javascript returns reference and not a copy of the array when a queue is dequeued. (I took a lot of time to even find the bug using debugger. I used chatgpt to find the solution for the bug i.e how to get the copy of the array from dequeue method instead of reference and finally corrected it).
